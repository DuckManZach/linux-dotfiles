# linux-dotfiles
The dotfiles to my personal linux setup.

some of these may require further configuration, but it should be a good start. Certainly way better than starting from scratch

run this first to get all the required stuff
`sudo pacman -S hyprland waybar foot bemenu vim grim slurp thunar wpaperd xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland pavucontrol`
